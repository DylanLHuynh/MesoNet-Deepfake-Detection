# Deepfake Detection with MesoNet (Honours Project)

This project was developed as part of my Honours research and focuses on detecting deepfakes using the MesoNet (Meso4) modelâ€”a compact convolutional neural network designed specifically for identifying facial forgeries in images and videos.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to test how well a lightweight deepfake detection model performs across different datasets. I implemented Meso4 in TensorFlow/Keras, loaded pretrained weights, and evaluated its accuracy on real and fake facial image data.

Through this project, I worked through model integration, preprocessing pipelines, predictions, and visualising outputs to better understand the strengths and limitations of current detection models.

## Key Objectives

- Implement the Meso4 deepfake detection architecture
- Load and apply pretrained weights for prediction
- Test the model's generalisation by evaluating on varied datasets
- Analyse model outputs and understand common misclassifications

## Technologies Used

- Python (Used 3.10.4)
- TensorFlow (2.16.1) / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter / VSCode


Make sure you have the correct folder structure and that the pretrained weights are saved as `.weights.h5` files in the correct path. Change file path to file directory of where the weights and data files are stored.

## About the Model

The Meso4 architecture is a compact CNN designed to detect subtle cues in manipulated facial images. It is particularly useful for low-resource environments where larger models may not be practical.

This implementation is based on:
